Answer the following questions with <add>, <subtract>, <multiply>, <divide> operators. Here are some examples.

Question: Mark has 3 tanks for pregnant fish. Each tank has 4 pregnant fish and each fish gives birth to 20 young. How many young fish does he have at the end?
Answer: He has 4*3=<multiply>(4, 3)=12 pregnant fish They give birth to 12*20=<multiply>(12, 20)=240 fish. The answer is 240. ###

Question: The math questions in a contest are divided into three rounds: easy, average, and hard. There are corresponding points given for each round. That is 2, 3, and 5 points for every correct answer in the easy, average, and hard rounds, respectively. Suppose Kim got 6 correct answers in the easy; 2 correct answers in the average; and 4 correct answers in the difficult round, what are her total points in the contest? 
Answer: Kim got 6 points/round x 2 round = <multiply>(6,2)=12 points in the easy round. She got 2 points/round x 3 rounds = <multiply>(2,3)=6 points in the average round. She got 4 points/round x 5 rounds = <multiply>(4,5)=20 points in the difficult round. So her total points is 12 points + 6 points + 20 points = <add>(12,6,20)=38 points. The answer is 38. ###

Question: A clothing store sells 20 shirts and 10 pairs of jeans. A shirt costs $10 each and a pair of jeans costs twice as much. How much will the clothing store earn if all shirts and jeans are sold?
Answer: Twenty shirts amount to $10 x 20 = $<multiply>(10, 20)=200. The cost of each pair of jeans is 10 x 2 = <multiply>(10,2)=20. So 10 pairs of jeans amount to 20 x 10 = <multiply>(20,10)=200. Therefore, the store will earn 200 + 200 = <add>(200,200)=400 if all shirts and jeans are sold. The answer is 400. ###
Question: Arnoldâ€™s collagen powder has 18 grams of protein for every 2 scoops. His protein powder has 21 grams of protein per scoop. And his steak has 56 grams of protein. If he has 1 scoop of collagen powder, 1 scoop of protein powder and his steak, how many grams of protein will he consume?
Answer: 2 scoops of collagen powder have 18 grams of protein and he only has 1 scoop so he consumes 18/2 = <divide>(18,2)=9 grams of protein He has 9 grams collagen powder, 21 grams of protein powder and 56 grams in his steak for a total of 9+21+56 = <add>(9,21,56)=86 grams of protein. The answer is 86. ###

You will be given a question, to answer it you will need to perform a series of calculations.
To solve the math problem, you should write the thought, action, and observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation, Action will be one of the following funcitons, and Observation will be the result of the action and possibly the next step.
1. add: use add(a, b, c, ...) and result == a + b + c + ...
2. subtract: use subtract(a, b) and result == a - b
3. multiply: use multiply(a, b , c ...) and result == a * b * c * ...
4. divide: use divide(a, b) and result == a / b
5. Finish[answer]: use Finish[answer] to finish the task.
Meanwhile, some calculation steps are provided for your reference, and you can directly use the result if you need it.
Here are some examples:
Example 1:
Question: Of the 3 friends, Harry has 4 times as many fish as Joe, and Joe has 8 times as many fish as Sam does. If Sam has 7 fish, how many fish does Harry have?
Reference Steps:

result[0] = 224.0
Action 2: result[1] = multiply[8, 7]

Action 3: result[2] = add[result[0], result[1]]
result[2] = 280.0
Action 4: result[3] = Finish[result[2]]
result[3] = 280.0

You should answer:
Thought 1: Let's think step by step. Sam has result 7 fish, so Joe has result[0] = multiply[7, 8] fish, and the reference tells me that result[0] = 56. Now, Harry has result[1] = multiply[result[0], 4] fish, and and the reference tells me that result[1] = 224. The question is asking for the number of fish Harry has, so I can finish now.
