Thought 1: I need to calculate the number of eggs she sells at the farmers' market first. Then I can calculate the amount she makes. Janet sells 16*3=Multiply[16,3] eggs per day. I need to compute Multiply[16,3].
Action 1: Multiply[16,3]
PAUSED 0
: The result is 48.
Thought 2: Now I can calculate the amount she makes at the farmers' market. She makes $2.0 per fresh duck egg, and she sells 48 eggs at the farmers' market. So she makes $2.0 x 48=Multiply[2,48]. I need to compute Multiply[2,48].
Action 2: Multiply[2,48]
PAUSED 0
: The result is 96.00.
Thought 3: The question is asking for the amount she makes at the farmers' market, the result is 96.00.
Action 3: Finish[96.00]

Thought 1: I need to calculate the total amount of blue fiber first. Then I can calculate the total amount of white fiber. The robe takes 2.0 bolts of blue fiber, so the total amount of blue fiber is 2.0*2.0=Multiply[2,2.0]. I need to compute Multiply[2,2.0].
Action 1: Multiply[2,2.0]
PAUSED 1
: The result is 4.0.
Thought 2: Now I can calculate the total amount of white fiber. The robe takes half that much white fiber, so the total amount of white fiber is 4.0/2=Divide[4.0,2]. I need to compute Divide[4.0,2].
Action 2: Divide[4.0,2]
PAUSED 1
[ERROR]Error: action parsing failed. 

 : The result is 2.0.
Thought 3: So the total amount of fiber is 4.0+2.0=Add[4.0,2.0]. I need to compute Add[4.0,2.0].
Action 3: Add[4.0,2.0]
Observation 3
: The result is 6.0.
Thought 4: The question is asking for the total amount of fiber, the result is 6.0.
Action 4: Finish[6.0]
Observation 4: Stopped. 3

Thought 1: I need to calculate the total meters he runs in a week first. Then I can calculate the number of sprints he runs. James runs 60.0 meters each sprint, and he runs 3 sprints/week. I need to compute Multiply[60.0,3].
Action 1: Multiply[60.0,3]
PAUSED 2
: The result is 180.0 meters.
Thought 2: Now I know the total meters he runs in a week, I can calculate the number of sprints he runs. James runs 180.0 meters/sprint, and he runs 3 sprints/week. I need to compute Multiply[180.0,3].
Action 2: Multiply[180.0,3]
PAUSED 2
: The result is 540.0 meters.
Thought 3: The question is asking for the total meters he runs a week, the result is 540.0 meters.

Thought 1: I need to calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon. Then I can calculate the amount of feed needed in the final meal. Wendi gives 15.0 cups of feed in the morning, and 25.0 cups of feed in the afternoon. So the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15.0+25.0=Add[15.0,25.0]. I need to compute Add[15.0,25.0].
Action 1: Add[15.0,25.0]
